Implement a hotel system with a Java frontend and a MySQL backend. The command line-based frontend contains flows to: create a new account in the system; reserve (possibly multiple) rooms under a single reservation paid by a single card; leave reviews for rooms, services, and breakfasts; and view certain statistics about reservations in an indicated time frame, such as most popular breakfasts across all hotels. The MySQL backend contains tables holding information about: customer credentials, hotels, rooms, services, breakfasts, their corresponding reviews, as well as reservations that can have multiple room reservations, and the card that the reservation was paid with.
